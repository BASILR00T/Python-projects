# ToDo List Application

A simple command-line ToDo list application that allows users to add tasks and save them to a file.

## Features

2. Enter tasks one by one. Each task will be added to the list.
3. Type `quit` when you're done adding tasks.
4. If the list is not empty, you'll be prompted to name your list. The list will be saved as a `.txt` file with the name you provide.
5. The application will display the saved list and exit.
